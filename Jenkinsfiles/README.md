# Jenkinsfile and jenkins configuration

## Requirements

#### Jenkins plugins
* pipeline
* git
* docker-pipeline

#### Caveats
The pipeline won't run as-is. It requires credentials for dockerhub to push the image. The docker-pipeline plugin also needs access to a docker client, thus, if containerized, has to be provided inside the image, and the docker.sock has to be mounted in. 
The deployment in the kubernetes cluster requires authentication. I decided to use the certificates generated by minikube, previously copied in the `jenkins_home`.
